# Peering
This is a simple tutorial on how to peer with people.

## Peering (physically)
To physically peer with someone all you need to do is connect your computers/routers with a cable.

## Peering (over internet)
To peer with someone over the internet you will need to find their IPv6 address and configure it like this:
```
Peers: [
  tcp://PutIPAddressHere
]
```
